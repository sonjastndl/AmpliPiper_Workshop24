# README: Test Data Set for Training Purposes

## Overview

This repository contains test data sets derived from several sources and is used as workshop repository for AmpliPiper.

AmpliPiper is a comprehensive workflow based on BASH scripting, Python and R for analyzing high-throughput amplicon sequencing data for multiple samples and loci. The pipeline performs various tasks, including raw read demultiplexing, filtering, consensus sequence reconstruction, species identification and phylogenetic analysis.
